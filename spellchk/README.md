## Installation

Make sure you setup your virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U -r requirements.txt

You can optionally copy and modify the requirements for when we
test your code:

    cp requirements.txt answer/requirements.txt

## Required files

You must create the following files:

    answer/spellchk.py
    answer/spellchk.ipynb

## Create output.zip

To create the `output.zip` file for upload to Coursys do:

    python3 zipout.py

For more options:

    python3 zipout.py -h

## Create source.zip

To create the `source.zip` file for upload to Coursys do:

    python3 zipsrc.py

For more options:

    python3 zipsrc.py -h

## Check your accuracy

To check your accuracy on the dev set:

    python3 check.py

For more options:

    python3 check.py -h

In particular use the log file to check your output evaluation:

    python3 check.py -l log

The accuracy on `data/input/test.tsv` will not be shown.  We will
evaluate your output on the test input after the submission deadline.

## Default solution

The default solution is provided in `default.py`. To use the default
as your solution:

    cp default.py answer/spellchk.py
    cp default.ipynb answer/spellchk.ipynb
    python3 zipout.py
    python3 check.py

Make sure that the command line options are kept as they are in
`default.py`. You can add to them but you must not delete any
command line options that exist in `default.py`.

Submitting the default solution without modification will get you
zero marks.

## Data files

The data files provided are:

* `data/input` -- input files `dev.tsv` and `test.tsv`
* `data/reference/dev.out` -- the reference output for the `dev.tsv` input file
